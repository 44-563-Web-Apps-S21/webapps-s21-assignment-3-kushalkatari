    <h1>Black Elephant</h1>
    <p>Elephants are the strongest mammals and the strongest land animals.
        Elephants are not only being squeezed into smaller and smaller areas,
         but farmers plant crops that elephants like to eat. As a result,
          elephants frequently raid and destroy crops. They can be very dangerous too,
          the animals often inspire fear and anger in those who share their land. </p>
